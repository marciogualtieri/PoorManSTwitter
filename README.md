# Poor Man's Twitter

The purpose of this project is to showcase some of my full-stack development skills in Python and Javascript.

The solution is comprised of the two individual projects:

- [Poor Man's Twitter API](./PoorManSTwitterAPI), a back-end developed with the Django Framework.

- [Poor Man's Twitter UI](./PoorManSTwitterUI), a front-end developed with Vue.JS.

Each project has its own readme file. For more details, please visit their correspondent readme files.
