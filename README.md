# Poor Man's Twitter

The purpose of this project is to showcase some of my full-stack development skills in Python (the Django Framework specificaly) and Javascript (Vue.JS).

The solution is comprised of two individual projects:

- [Poor Man's Twitter API](./PoorManSTwitterAPI), the back-end service (a RESTful API).

- [Poor Man's Twitter UI](./PoorManSTwitterUI), the front-end service (a single-page web app).

Each project has its own readme file, so please refer to them for futher details.
